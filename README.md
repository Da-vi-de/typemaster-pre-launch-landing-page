### Built with

### What I learned

I learned the CSS property mix-blend-mode, useful to make the orange effect on the image, combined with some opacity.

```
.phone-keyboard {
    width: 8rem;
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    opacity: 0.75;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - I've just searched on google
"How to blend colors in css" and i found the usual but useful resources!
